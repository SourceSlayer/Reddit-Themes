This is a collection of CSS pages designed by [/u/SourceSlayer](http://www.reddit.com/u/sourceslayer) on reddit.

If you'd like, you could follow my projects on twitter at [@SlackingSource](https://twitter.com/SlackingSource) or at my subreddit at [/r/slackingsource](http://www.reddit.com/r/slackingsource). It's really a ghost town there at the moment because I haven't launched what I was supposed to.


CSS Templates
=============
These are CSS templates from various communities. It may not be the cleaniest and not all the stylesheets are avaliable because I want the subreddit owners to give me permission first.


So far, there are many subreddit styles available:

- [/r/fastfoodreview](http://www.reddit.com/r/fastfoodreview) -- A place to discuss and review fastfood.
